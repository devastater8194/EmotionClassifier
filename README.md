Emotion Classification Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on building an image-based emotion classification system using deep learning techniques. The objective is to classify facial images into emotional categories, primarily Happy and Sad, by learning discriminative visual features from image data.

The implementation is provided in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, which covers the complete machine learning pipeline starting from dataset preparation to model evaluation. Image data is preprocessed through resizing, normalization, and label encoding to ensure compatibility with the neural network architecture.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as the core model for emotion recognition. The network is trained on labeled facial images and optimized using backpropagation and gradient-based optimization techniques. Performance metrics such as accuracy and loss are analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.

Due to GitHub limitations related to large numbers of files, the image dataset is included as a compressed archive. This repository is intended for academic and learning purposes, demonstrating practical application of deep learning concepts in computer vision.
